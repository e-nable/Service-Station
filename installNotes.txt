# Since there may be personal and medical information communicated through 
# this server, it's recommended to also install SSL.
# Use the apache documentation to install it. In short it comes down to:
# make sure you have a certificate from a certificate authority (costs 
# involved but recommended) or sign-it yourself (free, not recommended).
## Install your certificate.
## Enable ssl:
# a2ensite default-ssl.conf
## Configure it:
# vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
## restart Apache to make the change effective
# service apache2 restart

# Change variable "baseDNS" to reflect the information
# this is critical as it'll be used to build the URLs for all email
# based on generated ticketing information. Leave as localhost
# for local implementations

# --------------------------------------------
# Mail configuration
# --------------------------------------------

# First, install all necessary packages:

sudo apt-get install zip postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules

# If you do not have postfix installed before, postfix configuration wizard
# will ask you some questions. Select your server as 'Internet Site' 
# and for FQDN use something like mail.example.com
#
# Then open your postfix config file:

vim /etc/postfix/main.cf

# configure it as below:

relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
smtp_use_tls = yes

# save and move on

vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

# And add following line:

[smtp.gmail.com]:587    USERNAME@gmail.com:PASSWORD

# Fix permission and update postfix config to use sasl_passwd file:

sudo chmod 400 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

# Next, validate certificates to avoid running into error.
# Just run following command:

cat /etc/ssl/certs/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.pem | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/cacert.pem

# Finally, reload postfix config for changes to take effect:

sudo /etc/init.d/postfix reload

# Testing
# Check if mails are sent via Gmail SMTP server
# change the you@example.com address below per your test account

echo "Test mail from postfix" | mail -s "Test Postfix" you@example.com


# --------------------------------------------
# Testing / Debugging
# --------------------------------------------

# Walk through the app, enter a working email
# If the email is received and the URL works, we're done.

# The following is in case there are problems...

# NOTE THAT NO NEW EMAIL NOR WORK WILL BE DONE FOR TICKETS ALREADY COMPLETED
# Ticket IDs are unique by [server hash]-[user email hash]-[parameters hash]
# Next dev cycle will allow retreival of previously generated content
# through the use of the ticket number 
# If subsequent tests with the same parameters needs to be built for testing, 
# [ticket number].sh, [ticket number] directory, [ticket number].zip need to
# be removed if present. 

# Generate and check the log.txt in the root of the app
# An entry such as the following should be seen:

# SAMPLE:
# ---------------------------------------------------
#   Starting Full Assembly: 
#    Email: user@domain.com 
#    Ticket: 7412225538-3017136727-39654222
#
#    Params: 0 -D Left1=0 -D Left2=0 -D Left3=0 -D Left4=0 -D Left5=0 -D Left6=0 -D Left7=0 -D Left8=87 -D Left9=97 -D Left10=0 -D Right1=0 -D Right2=0 -D Right3=0 -D Right4=0 -D Right5=0 -D Right6=0 -D Right7=0 -D Right8=0 -D Right9=0 -D Right10=0-D prostheticHand=1 -D gauntletSelect=3 -D fingerSelect=4 -D palmSelect=5 -D Padding=5 -D WristBolt=0 -D KnuckleBolt=0 -D JointBolt=0 -D ThumbBolt=0 
#
#   Completed (user@domain.com):  Fri Oct 3 02:17:42 EDT 2014
# ---------------------------------------------------

# ./ticket should contain a .zip file after completion
# If not, permissions for ticket directory should be read write exectute 
# for www-data or equivalent apache user service

# If the Complete message is logged and tickets directory
# contains the associated ticket directory and or sh file 
# (same as noted ticket) then there might have been a problem executing
# either all or part of the script.

# General workflow for each ticket is:
# - Directory created
# - Script created with all openscad commands for each part
# - Script is execture
#   + Each command executes
#   + Logging information is added
#   + Email template is used, data is seeded, html file is created 
#   + Directory is zipped
#   + Email is sent
#   + sh script is removed

# If a directory is left, it should contain on completion:
# - log.txt
# - README.html
# - STL files

# -------------------------------------------------
# To check that the service is working:
# -------------------------------------------------
# change the below YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM 
# and WEB_URL
# ... use the following in your browser

http://WEB_URL/service.php?email=YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM&part=1&type=make&gauntletSelect=3&fingerSelect=4&palmSelect=5&Padding=5&prostheticHand=0&Right1=62.67&Right2=65.62&Right3=59.14&Right4=48.78&Right5=51.85&Right6=16.4&Right7=0&Right8=72.52&Right9=72.23&Right10=230.6&Left1=66.47&Left2=64.04&Left3=46.95&Left4=35.14&Left5=35.97&Left6=27.27&Left7=31.80&Left8=40.97&Left9=31.06&Left10=147.5

# There will be four states which can be matched by the description for each status update:

# - "Initiated" returned when a new item is requested

# After the directory is made:
# - "In Progress": when the ticket is in the process of being executed
# It is possible that it may never complete - check the associated directory
# to see how far it progressed

# Once it's completed:
# - "Completed" ... which should contain the url: "http://domain.com/ticket/3153980626.zip"

# And the error state which is only returned if there are validation issues:
# -  "Email Error", url: ""}
